# XKCD HoverText #

This extension allows you to view xkcd mouse over text in a hover box instead of the normal built-in tooltip (which generally doesn't stay up very long and doesn't look nice, etc).

The appearance and behavior of the box is highly customizable (check out the options page for the extension).

[Get it on chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xkcd-hovertext/lbbfkdbeojkogjofbololpkmghdgdmkp)
